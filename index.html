    <h6 >"Hello friends I just want you to know that you are not going astray, yes you are right here on my page before anything else I want to ask for forgiveness because I did not prepare it well because I was busy preparing documents for our thesis. Anyway my dream was fulfilled to have my own page, Thanks to the knowledge given by our professor Miss Almeda Asuncion, You see, I learned how to build this page even though its simple at least I've learned to read css codes. I hope you like the content of my page because I work for it in several days, I'm just kidding. I built it with all my heart and all my mind thanks to your time visiting my page I hope you enjoy and be inspired."</h6>
