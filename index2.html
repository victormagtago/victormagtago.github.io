I really grew up in Pasig from Barangay Bambang. Almost a decade we've lived in our day-to-day life witness the difficulties and anguish of our family there. Maybe you're wondering who's in the picture with me, She is my beloved Grandma. At the portrait it was the when I graduated from elementary she was always with me at every graduation from preschool to high school. I can say I was so blessed and I had such kind of grandmother that we were always guided up to my growth. 
      <hr>
      It's nice to have a grandmother especially when you talk about her past life and give you guidance and lesson on what to do in life.Sometimes it's a good thing to remember about the past when she's just there besides telling me a problem, talking about what happened to her all day, being with me and taking food every day, and I can say the words "I love you Lola"."Thank you Lola".  "I Miss you Lola".</h5>

      As a student I would like to focus on my studies so that I can gain knowledge and expertise when it comes to my work in the future. Perhaps I can say that learning is one of the fun things to do in life, you only listen to what the professors teach and have my own research to shape what I want to know. Many like me have a lot to do but have no chance of study perhaps for lack of money to continue. I'm lucky because I've been given a chance to study again, I can say that this is a blessing for me .

      I can promise to try to fulfill my parent's dream to finish my studies. I'm trying my best to be a good student in all my subjects even in my school's activities. I will continue with the inspiration and guidance of the Lord.

      I grew up with a simple yet happy family. We always go to church each week with each other since my childhood. I remember as I grow up my mood changes to what and how I interact with people, it affects my behavior. actually I grew taciturn and indifferent to someone else who was with me, maybe it was because we were not allowed to go out of the house when I was a kid I was always confined to the house. I have seen my parents the hardships of life, I see them how they work to give our siblings our daily necessities.
